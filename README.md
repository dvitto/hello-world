# hello-world
so many people are getting ripped off online enough is enough 
i want to build a saftey net, online sheriff that will shut scammers down
or a new ecomrece site that has saftey nets so when a thief trys to pull you away from protocal
in a flash before there even done typing ip address is pulled, takes a picture of them and flashes there real name and address across the web
i tried to sale things on ebay and all i got was alot of waisted time scammers trying to get me to give up my money with some story about a nephews birthday or milatary5 going over seas
enough is enough facebook market place is full of fake adds trying to get you to put in your info some look pretty real the only way to tell is by reading everything even the return policy where one add is for a drone you wouldnt tell it was a scam untill you read the 4th paragraph and its copied and paste of lady watches  it says to return the watch must be in and the ladies will love the color thats when i startyed looking into every add
75% of the adds are scames why is it so easy for them 
we work to hard for are money for some crook to get rich
safty protocals should be in places proof of who you are where you are from and if you really have what you say you have
if a site was made where we can garuntee 100% safeness i belive it would be bigger than amazon
so who is with me lets build somthing that will help millions of pepole
